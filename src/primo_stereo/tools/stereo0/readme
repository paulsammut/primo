Here I spent an hour making a script that will quickly unpack calibration data from
packed tar file that the calibrator makes to the right folder

primo_stereo
| config
| | stereo0
| | | archive
| | | | calfile.tar.gz
| | | | sav_cal.sh
| | stereo1
| | | archive
| | | | calfile.tar.gz
| | | | sav_cal.sh

Unfortunately the way I made it requires two copies of it
