        The reason we have this file as an xml, and not launch file, is so that it
        does not clutter the launch file space of this package. This file is only
        meant to be included in both real and sim urdf launch files and is not intended 
        to be run by itself.  It contains the common nodes necessary for a loading of
        the description of our Primo robot.
